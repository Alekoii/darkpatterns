# Android

### 1. Default App Settings
- Pre-selected Google services and apps as defaults
- Making it multi-step process to change default apps
- Prompting users to switch back to Google apps when using alternatives

### 2. Privacy Controls
- Spreading privacy settings across multiple menus and submenus
- Using confusing terminology for privacy options
- Making privacy-protective options require more steps than data-sharing ones
- Presenting data collection as necessary for "improved services"

### 3. Google Account Integration
- Repeatedly prompting for Google account sign-in
- Making certain features unavailable without Google account
- Suggesting that device functionality will be limited without Google services
- Making it unclear which features require Google services versus Android core features

### 4. App Store Manipulation
- Promoting Google Play Store apps over third-party app stores
- Making installation from alternative sources require multiple security confirmations
- Using security warnings that may overly discourage third-party app installations
- Making it complex to use alternative app stores

### 5. Location Services
- Persistent prompts to enable location services
- Bundling useful features with location tracking
- Making it difficult to understand which apps use location in background
- Using vague language about location data collection purposes

### 6. Notification Management
- Making notifications opt-out rather than opt-in
- Requiring individual management for each app's notifications
- Using persuasive messaging to keep notifications enabled
- Making bulk notification management less accessible

### 7. Data Backup and Sync
- Presenting Google backup as the only reliable backup solution
- Making it unclear what data is being backed up and when
- Using fear of data loss to encourage cloud backup enrollment
- Making local backup options less prominent

### 8. Update System
- Making system updates difficult to defer
- Using persistent notifications for updates
- Bundling privacy policy changes with feature updates
- Making it hard to understand what changes updates bring

### 9. AI and Assistant Features
- Making AI features opt-out rather than opt-in
- Presenting AI features as essential for normal operation
- Bundling useful features with increased data collection
- Using unclear language about AI data usage

### 10. App Permissions
- Making permission management complex
- Using vague descriptions for permission requirements
- Making it difficult to revoke permissions after granting
- Bundling necessary and unnecessary permissions together

### 11. Device Setup
- Fast-track setup that skips privacy options
- Making custom setup more time-consuming
- Pre-selecting data-sharing options during setup
- Using "recommended" settings that favor Google services

### 12. Performance Optimization
- Suggesting that third-party apps impact performance more than Google apps
- Making battery optimization more aggressive for non-Google apps
- Using battery warnings to discourage certain app usage
- Making custom optimization difficult

The impact of these patterns is particularly significant because Android is a dominant mobile operating system globally. These designs can:
- Create dependency on Google services
- Make privacy-conscious choices more difficult
- Limit user awareness of alternatives
- Increase the complexity of maintaining privacy
- Lead to unintended data sharing
- Create friction when trying to use non-Google services
