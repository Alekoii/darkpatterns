# Google Search

### 1. Privacy and Data Collection
- Making privacy settings complex and multi-layered

- Pushing users toward staying signed into Google accounts

### 2. Search Result Manipulation
- Making ads look increasingly similar to organic results
- Using subtle "Sponsored" labels that blend with surroundings
- Placing multiple ads before organic results
- Pushing organic results further down the page with various widgets

### 3. Google Service Integration
- Prominently featuring Google products (Maps, Shopping, YouTube) above organic results
- Making Google's own services visually more appealing than external results
- Using prime screen real estate for Google features rather than direct search results
- Auto-expanding Google features while collapsing competing sources

### 4. Mobile Experience Manipulation
- Making scrolling past Google features more cumbersome on mobile

### 7. Search Behavior Manipulation
- Suggesting related searches that keep users in Google's ecosystem
- Using auto-complete to influence search behavior

### 8. Location and Device Tracking
- Making location tracking opt-out difficult to find
- Using persistent location history unless explicitly disabled
- Tying device settings to account settings in complex ways
- Making full privacy control require understanding multiple interconnected settings

### 9. Market Position Exploitation
- Making alternative search engines harder to set as defaults

- Using cross-service integration to increase switching costs

### 10. User Attention Manipulation
