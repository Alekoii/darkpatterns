# Introduction

Dark patterns are deliberate design choices in user interfaces that manipulate or deceive users into making decisions they wouldn't otherwise make. First coined by Harry Brignull in 2010, these design practices prioritize business interests over user wellbeing and ethical considerations.

Think of dark patterns as digital sleight of hand â€“ they're the web equivalent of a store's confusing layout designed to make you walk past more products, or the tiny print in contracts that hides important details. But in the digital realm, these manipulative practices can be implemented with greater precision and sophistication.

Common examples include:

1. **Forced continuity** - making it easy to start a subscription but difficult to cancel it
2. **Hidden costs** - concealing fees until late in the checkout process
3. **Misdirection** - designing interfaces that draw attention away from important but commercially unfavorable options
4. **Privacy Zuckering** - tricking users into sharing more personal information than they intended to
5. **Roach Motel** - making it very easy to get into a situation but very difficult to get out

What makes dark patterns particularly effective in digital interfaces is their ability to exploit human psychology and behavioral biases. They take advantage of our tendency to choose convenience over security, our susceptibility to artificial scarcity, and our instinct to follow social proof.

The rise of dark patterns coincides with the increasing pressure on digital platforms to monetize their user base and maximize engagement metrics. As businesses compete for user attention and conversion, some resort to these manipulative practices despite their ethical implications.

Understanding dark patterns is crucial for both users and designers. For users, awareness helps in recognizing and resisting manipulation. For designers, it raises important questions about professional ethics and the long-term consequences of prioritizing short-term business gains over user trust and wellbeing.
